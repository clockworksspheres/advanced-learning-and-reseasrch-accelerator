# Youtube video tutorial:

* [iUnderstanding Python: Click-based CLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVFO2ABZqK8)

Checkout the Git repo:

[JacobCallahan/Understanding](https://github.com/JacobCallahan/Understanding)

the file in that repo:


```
Python/click_cli/pizza_builder.py
```

is the file that the video ends up building.  
  
The video starts with an argparse example of how one would write the functionality, and translates its functionality to the above pizza_builder.py.

## Note:

Tried double space in this README.md after a couple of lines, to see if it would work - need to validate when loaded into an app that renders markdown...
