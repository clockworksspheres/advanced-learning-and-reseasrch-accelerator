# learning-accelerator

## WARNING

1. This directory is intended to be used as a loose ideas of future direction for the project.

2. The further the modification date of this file is from the current date - the less likely these file match the actual details of the design.  Design changes are often made to released software projects (in general) where design documents may not be updated or curated.

## Purpose

The purpose of this software is to provide frameworks and automation around the learning and research process.  The [Kerko](https://github.com/whiskyechobravo/kerko) project inspired this project, along with the experience project developers and maintainers have in ETL, file parsing and web scraping.

## Design and Architecture

### Pattern

Modified Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, melded with the von neumann computer model.

# Utilities used:

My personal preferance is to use locally installed apps for design works, as I take my dev machine with me places, and do not always have internet to access internet based web applications for design work.  These applications can all be installed locally, although some can be available via internet services.
